# WWSEF-2024
Codebase for my Waterloo Wellington Science Engineering Fair project.  

I did all SQL and star velocity calculations. All the C# backend (i.e. the entirety of the Barnes Hut simulation) and part of the frontend were taken from Tim Koreman. The original repository seems to be gone, so I will not be reuploading it out of respect. However, it will be available upon request if you have a valid reason.   

I have an interpretation of the Barnes-Hut simulation on my GitHub, which is written in C# but runs in Unity. Check it out!
